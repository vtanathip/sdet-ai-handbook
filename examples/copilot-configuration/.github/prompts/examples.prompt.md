# Example Prompts for this Workspace

Here are effective prompts to use with the configured Copilot setup.

## Code Generation

- "Create a new validation skill for validating US phone numbers in `skills/validationUtils.ts`."
- "Scaffold a unit test suite for the `isStrongPassword` function using Jest."

## Refactoring

- "Refactor `isValidEmail` to separate the regex pattern into a constant."
- "Convert this promise-based function to use async/await."

## Agent Tasks

- "@workspace Explain how the validation skills are structured in this project."
- "/explain How does the `docs-agent` definition relate to the actual codebase?"

## Variable Naming

- "Rename variables in this function to be more descriptive following our Senior SDET persona."
